# Use names and or company names to find Facebook profiles üîç

Starting from a spreadsheet filled with a list of names (and/or company names), Phantombuster will use search engines to automatically match names with their Facebook profile URLs.

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 
- **"spreadsheetUrl"**: link of your spreadsheet

## 4. Setting the Spreadsheet
Prepare a spreadsheet with **first name**/**last name** in a single cell

In order to match your search query with an Facebook profile our API will use different search engines such as Google, Duckduckgo, Bing, Ecosia...

If the name you are searching for is pretty common we highly recommend you to add a **company name** in your search query for higher chances of positive results. 

You can also only search **company names**


## 5. Column Name

With one query per cell, make sure that first name/last name & company are in the same cell.
Use `columnName` to show our API what name you wrote on top of that column.
In the example above our `columnName` is: `Name_of_your_column`

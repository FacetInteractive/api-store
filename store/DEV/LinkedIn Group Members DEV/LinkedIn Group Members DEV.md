## 3. Linkedin authentication 🔑 { argument }
_(You already know how to get your sessionCookie? <a href="#section_posturl">skip this part</a>)_  
Because the script will manipulate LinkedIn for you, it needs to be logged in to your LinkedIn account. For that you just need to copy paste your session cookie in the script argument:
* Using Chrome, go to your LinkedIn homepage and open the inspector  
→ Right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect” ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)  
→ <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on macOS  
or  
→ <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>MAJ</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows

* Locate the “Application” tab

## 4. Add a LinkedIn group URL 📑 {posturl}
Below your session cookie you’ll find **Group URL**

Add, in the textbox, the link of the group you want to scrape (once again, you **must be a member** of the group)

You will be able to gather up to 2500 profiles! (this is a limitation from LinkedIn)

## 5. Name your future CSV {csv}
Optionally enter the name of the group you're scraping. This name will be the name of your brand new CSV.

Click on 💾 <span style="color:blue">Save</span>

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

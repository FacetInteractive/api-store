# All your prospects need is love!
I remember being a superstar because a lot of people liked my tweets. Nothing is more rewarding! If you love me, I'll love you in return 😍
Sincerely — Your sweet prospect

# Warm up your Twitter prospects before talking to them
If you want to warm up a prospect on Twitter, you'll have to like their tweets. Start with a list of Twitter users and be ready to like their last tweets. How many? It depends on how much love you want to spread!

## With this API:
✔️ Visit up **10 Twitter profiles** per launch
⏳ Like up to **10 tweets** per user

# What do you need? ⚙️
- **"Spreadsheet URL"**: Link of a pubicly accessible spreadsheet containing a list of twitter profile urls
- **"Session Cookie auth_token"**: Your Twitter `auth_token` session cookie.

# Which steps to follow?
## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com 💻

## 4. Create a nice Spreadsheet
In this 1st argument field paste the URL of a spreadsheet filled with Twitter profile URLs, all **on column A**

The API would follow each one of those 1 by 1

## 5. Get your Twitter Session cookie
The Session Cookie you'll need to make this API work is called "`auth_token`",
Here's how you can get yours:

* Using Chrome, go to your Twitter homepage and open the inspector
→ Right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect” ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)

## 6. Configure repetitive launches

Twitter will limit this automation over time (if you force this, you can be banned from Twitter).

That is why this API will only like up to **10 tweets per launch**. To like many tweets, simply configure repetitive launches. All your follow requests will be spread out over days or weeks if necessary.

To do so, go into "Settings" > "Launch" > "Repetitvely". A good setting is something like "Once per working hour".

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

# Use company names to find their LinkedIn pages üîç

- **Column name**: title of the column containing company names

## 4. Setting the Spreadsheet { argument }
Prepare a Google Spreasheet listing **company names** (one name per row)

In order to match your search query with a LinkedIn page our API will use different Web search engines such as Google, Duckduckgo, Bing and others...

If the name you are searching for is pretty common we highly recommend you to add any other qualifying info in your search query for higher chances of good results.

You can also provide an URL to a CSV file, it will work the same.

**Make sure your Google Spreadsheet or CSV file is publicly accessible!**

## 5. Column Name

With one query per cell, make sure that each company name is in a different cell.

Use `column name` to tell our API which column to use. By default, we'll use the first column (A).

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏è Repetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

If your input spreadsheet has a lot of rows, your Phantombuster account might not have enough execution time to find all the company URLs in a single day. No worries though! You can set up **an automatic launch per day** to continue finding company URLs over weeks or months if necessary.

To do so, first go to your API's settings:

Then, select `Once per day` (or another frequency if you prefer):

Now that this is set, click üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page. That's it! Your API will now add more and more rows to your result CSV file every day, automatically.

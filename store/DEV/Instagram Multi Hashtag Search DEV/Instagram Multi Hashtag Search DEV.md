# Find the IG posts that matter the most

This API will search for multiple hashtags and/or location on Instagram at the same time, then **return the posts that match at least two of them**.

For example, using `#vegan` and `Paris, France` as input, you'll know who's talking about vegetables in the most beautiful city in the world!

To get your imagination going, here are some other examples:
- `#sponsored + #healthy`: Healthy posts being sponsored on IG right now
- `#beach + #makeup`: Makeup products that are beach-ready
- `#ootd + San Francisco, California`: Who's wearing what in SF today?

You get the idea! There is no limit to the number of hashtags you can use, so if you're feeling like a power user, put more than 2 :)

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 
- **List of hashtags and/or locations**: Provide a list of hashtags beginning with # (like `#phantombuster`) or a locations (like `New York, New York`) and the API will find the IG posts that match at least two of them
- **Session cookie (sessionid)**: Your Instagram `sessionid` session cookie (more info below)

## 4. Enter at least two hashtags/locations
In the 1st configuration field, you have to add at least 2 hashtags or locations so that the API can search for those terms in Instagram.

You can also enter a Google spreadsheet URL or a CSV containing multiple hashtags or locations as first search term.

# Limits

Instagram limits the number of requests you can do **per hour, per account**. We've found that in general, after doing a search for 2 hashtags/locations of 1500 posts each, **Phantombuster the API will have to slow down**. This is done automatically for you.

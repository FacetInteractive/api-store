For each Chrome extension, the API will automatically:
- Extract all reviews
- Save all the data in a CSV file in the cloud

# What you'll need to set to make it work ? ‚öôÔ∏è

- **CSV/ Spreadsheet URL or Chrome extension URL**:
- **Column name into the CSV/Spreadsheet**:
- **Number of extensions to scrape per launch**:

## 4. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below the section **CSV/ Spreadsheet URLs or URLs to scrape** you‚Äôll be able to define the list of URLs on which you want to work.

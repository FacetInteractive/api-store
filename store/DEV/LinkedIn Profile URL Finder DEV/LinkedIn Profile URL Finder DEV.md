# Use names to find LinkedIn profiles üîç

You have THE prospect list somewhere. However, you lack the LinkedIn profiles that match people on that list. Once you have it, you'll be able to start a conversation with your future customers.

This API can easily be combined with our other LinkedIn APIs, most notably <a href="/api-store/2818/linkedin-network-booster", target="_blank">LinkedIn Network Booster</a>.

# Our Solution
Starting from a spreadsheet filled with a list of names, Phantombuster will use Web search engines to automatically match names with their LinkedIn profile URLs.

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 
- **Spreadsheet URL**: link to a spreadsheet containing first and last names (and optionally company names)
- **Column name**: title of the column from which to get names

# Which steps to follow?

## 4. Setting the Spreadsheet { argument }
Prepare a spreadsheet with **first name**/**last name** in a single cell. It can either be a Google Spreadsheet or a CSV file. Make sure your file is publicly accessible on that URL!

In order to match your search query with a LinkedIn profile our API will use different search engines such as Google, Duckduckgo, Bing and others...

If the name you are searching for is pretty common we highly recommend you to add a **company name** in your search query for higher chances of positive results.

You can also add a city, location or other pieces of information that you might have in your list.

## 5. Column name

With one query per cell, make sure that first name/last name & company are in the same cell.
Use `column name` to show our API what name you wrote on top of that column.
In the example above our `columnn name` is: `Name_of_your_column`

By default we'll fetch the first column of your sheet (column A).

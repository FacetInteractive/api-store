# How to automatically find the LinkedIn Profiles of a list of names? üîç

You have a prospect list but you only have names and perhaps a company. **How to _quickly_ transform it into something valuable?**

This automation API will help you turn a dry prospect's list into valuable LinkedIn Profile URLs.

## Our Solution
Starting from a spreadsheet filled with a list of names, Phantombuster will use Web search engines to automatically match names with their LinkedIn profile URLs.

## Combine API and set your Prospection process on automatic. 

Once you'll have this list of Profiles, you'll be able to use other Phantombuster tools to **transform these people into valuable leads**.

You could for example use <a href="/api-store/2818/linkedin-network-booster", target="_blank">LinkedIn Network Booster</a> and automatically connect with them on LinkedIn.

Or you could extract email addresses out of a lot of them if you pair Phantombuster with [Hunter.io](http://www.hunter.io) or [DropContact.io](http://www.dropcontact.io). 

Our tutorial [From a name to an email address](https://blog.phantombuster.com/from-a-name-to-an-email-address-5e31b804bebb) will explain each step in details.

## 4. Setting the Spreadsheet { argument }
**Prepare a spreadsheet with your prospect name in a single cell**. We recommend using Google Spreadsheet to host that spreadsheet online. Make sure your file is publicly accessible on that URL.

In order to match your search query with a LinkedIn profile, our API will use different search engines such as Google, Duckduckgo, Bing and others...

If the name you are searching for is pretty common we highly recommend you to add a **company name** in your search query for higher chances of positive results.

You can also add a city, location or other pieces of information that you might have in your list.

## 5. Column name

With one query per cell, make sure that first name/last name & company are in the same cell.
Use `column name` to show our API what name you wrote on top of that column.
In the example above our `column name` is: `Name_of_your_column`

By default, we'll fetch the first column of your sheet (column A).

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏è Repetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

If your input spreadsheet has a lot of rows, your Phantombuster account might not have enough execution time to find all the profile URLs in a single day. No worries though! You can set up **an automatic launch per day** to continue finding profile URLs over weeks or months if necessary.
You can choose how many lines to handle per launch. If you leave that configuration field empty, the API will try to process all of them.

Then, go to your API's settings:

Then, select `Once per day` (or another frequency if you prefer):

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/repetition-setup-once-per-day.png)</center>

Now that this is set, click üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page. That's it! Your API will now add more and more rows to your result CSV file every day, automatically.

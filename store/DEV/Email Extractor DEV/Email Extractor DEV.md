# Find email addresses in seconds!

Your prospects emails' are everywhere but they are hard to get!
The powerful Email Extractor API helps you to discover and extract emails automatically from web pages and export all of them to a CSV file.

As always on Phantombuster, **no need to keep you computer on**, everything happens in the cloud :D

# The process is simple

Starting with a list of URLs, from a Google spreadsheet or not, this API will automatically:
- Extract all available emails
- Save all addresses in a CSV file in the cloud
- Filters for duplicate email, on the same web sites

# What you'll need to set to make it work? ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet (or CSV) with LinkedIn profile URLs in it.
- **Number of follows per launch**: How many _(between **1** and **10**)_ profiles to follow per launch
- **Unfollow profiles**: If you need to undo what you've done, select this option to unfollow the profiles from your list.

_(**You already have all that?** Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_

# Export info from LinkedIn profiles

When building your CRM, you sometimes need to gather information from LinkedIn contacts/prospects. Don't waste your time copy/pasting anymore. Retrieve all the data you need of the specific LinkedIn profiles you're targeting in a CSV file.

# Our Solution

Launch an automated agent that will connect on LinkedIn as you. It will then browse and collect all the info from the designated profiles.


‚ùó<span style="color:red">**Caution**</span>‚ùó
1. _As the agent will connect to your account, use this script **sparingly**. LinkedIn only allows you to view a certain number of profiles per day/month. Consider this when launching the agent or it might get your account slowed down._

2. We've noticed that without LinkedIn Premium, you can only scrape 100 profiles in one go. Your mileage may vary.  

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.

## 4. Linkedin authentication üîë { argument }
Because the script will manipulate LinkedIn for you, it needs to be logged on your LinkedIn account. For that you just need to copy paste your session cookie in the script argument:
* Using Chrome, go to your LinkedIn homepage and open the inspector  
‚Üí Right click anywhere on the page and select ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)  
‚Üí <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on macOS  
or  
‚Üí <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>MAJ</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows

* Locate the ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù tab

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/li_at+1.png)</center>

* Select ‚ÄúCookies‚Äù > ‚Äúhttp://www.linkedin.com‚Äù on the left menu.

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/li_at+2.png)</center>

* Locate the ‚Äúli_at‚Äù cookie.

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/li_at+3.png)</center/>

* Copy what‚Äôs under ‚ÄúValue‚Äù (**Double click** on it then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) and paste it into your script _Argument_)

_// How to access your cookies with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/see_full_cookie_details_in_safari_5.1" target="_blank">Safari</a>//_

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below your session cookie you‚Äôll find _spreadsheetUrl_

Enter in the text field a link of a Google Spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_:
<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/1-Spreadsheet.png)</center>

Add every linkedIn profiles link in column A (**one link per row**)

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a CSV file URL, it will work the same :)


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.



# ‚öô Ô∏èHTTP API ü§ì

If you want to use this API programmatically you can **replace** the argument **_spreadsheetUrl_** by **_profileUrls_** which must be an array of strings.

It should look just like this :
`"profileUrls": ["www.linkedin.com/in/foo", "www.linkedin.com/in/bar"]`

# Limits

Please be aware that this API, like most of our LinkedIn APIs, will manipulate your own account on your behalf. Like *Uncle Ben* once said, *"With great power comes great responsibility."*

We have noticed that visiting more than 80 connections per day will almost always result in LinkedIn **invalidating your session cookie** (that is, logging you out). We recommend no more than one launch per day of 80 scraped profiles for this reason.

Having a LinkedIn Premium subscription might raise this limit. Please see these official LinkedIn help pages: [Commercial Use Limit](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950) and [Finding People on LinkedIn](https://premium.linkedin.com/professional/faq).

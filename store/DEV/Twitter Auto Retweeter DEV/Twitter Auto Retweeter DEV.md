# Auto-Retweet your Friends' and Favourite Influencer's Tweets!

Some content is always a good fit for your audience. And you systematically feel like Retweeting it. Instead of doing it by hand and taking the chance to miss some quality Tweets, set this process on automatic and focus on the real thing: creating the quality content.

Retweeting is also a great way to get noticed by people you like and wish to meet.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Recommendations 
Twitter is limiting users to a maximum of **2400 Tweets per day**. This includes Retweets. 

## ‚è≥ Execution speed

This API will Retweet on average **7 Tweets per minute**.

# What do you need? ‚öôÔ∏è
- **"Spreadsheet URL"**: Link of a pubicly accessible spreadsheet containing a list of twitter profile urls
- **"Session Cookie auth_token"**: Your Twitter `auth_token` session cookie.

# Which steps to follow?

## 4. Create a nice Spreadsheet
In the "Spreadsheet URL" field, paste the URL of a spreadsheet filled with Twitter profile URLs, all **on column A**.

The API will like tweets of those profiles over time.

If you do not put the profile URLs in the first column, you can specify the name of the column you used thanks to the "Column name" field in the configuration.

To get Twitter profile URLs, you can use our other Twitter APIs such as [Follower Collector](/api-store/4130/twitter-follower-collector), [Following Collector](/api-store/4457/twitter-following-collector) or [Profile URL Finder](/api-store/4485/twitter-profile-url-finder).

## 5. Get your Twitter Session cookie
The Session Cookie you'll need to make this API work is called "`auth_token`",
Here's how you can get yours:

* Using Chrome, go to your Twitter homepage and open the inspector

## 6. Configure repetitive launches

Twitter will limit this automation over time (if you force this, you can be banned from Twitter).

That is why this API will only like up to **10 tweets per launch**. To like many tweets, simply configure repetitive launches. All your follow requests will be spread out over days or weeks if necessary.

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/settings-button.png)</center>

Then, select a frequency:

# ‚öô Ô∏èHTTP API ü§ì

If you want to use this API programmatically you can **replace** the argument **_spreadsheetUrl_** by **_queries_** which must be an array of Twitter handles or Twitter profile URLs (strings). Additionally, you should set **_noDatabase_** to `true` so that the API does not maintain a state on its own (so that you can re-launch the same query to unlike tweets for example).

It should look just like this :
`{ "queries": ["phbuster", "paps__"], "noDatabase": true, "sessionCookie": "xxxx" }`

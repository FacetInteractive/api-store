# Extract info from Instagram profiles

You have a list of Instagram profiles and need to quickly extract information from them? Don't waste your time copy/pasting anymore. Retrieve all the data you need of the specific Instagram profiles you're targeting in a CSV file.

# Our Solution

Launch an automated agent that will connect as yourself on Instagram. It will then browse and collect all the info from the designated profiles.


# What will you need? ⚙️ 

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from Instagram.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet with Instagram profile URLs in it.

_(**You already have all that?**  Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_


# Which data will you collect?


1. Instagram profile link
1. Instagram username
1. Full name

## 4. Instagram authentication 🔑 { argument }
Because the script will manipulate Instagram for you, it needs to be logged on your Instagram account. For that you just need to copy paste your session cookie in the script argument:
* Using Chrome, go to your Instagram homepage and open the inspector
→ Right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect” ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)
→ <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on macOS
or
→ <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>MAJ</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows

* Locate the “Application” tab

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet 📑
Below your session cookie you’ll find _Spreadsheet URL_

Enter in the text field a link of a Google Spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_:
<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Instagram_Profile_Scrapper/inst_prfl_scrrpr_spreadsheet.png)</center>

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Instagram Profile URLs (**one link per row**).
You can specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a CSV file URL, it will work the same :)
You can also enter a single Instagram profile URL directly in the field.



# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.

# ⚙️️Repetition setup ⚙️ { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months. You can also specify the number of profiles to scrape per launch, or leave that field blank to scrape every profile from your list.


To do so, simply hit the “Settings” button to define when your API is launched:

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/settings-button.png)</center>

Then, select a frequency:

Don't forget to click 💾 <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page!

For example, 10 profiles scraped per launch, 8 launches per day: you'll have a total of 80 profiles per day. We recommend not exceeding these values with this API.

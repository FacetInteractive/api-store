# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

Now that your API is ready, you can customize it to make it work repetitively.

Use to 'Number of profiles to process per launch' field to configure how many profiles you want to scrape per launch (5 for instance will make it 5 profiles each launch then stop). Then set a repetition setup:

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.

# Limits

Please be aware that this API will manipulate your own account on your behalf.

Since Phantombuster's servers are located on the west coast of the USA, Facebook might to consider those login attempts as unusual activities. It's likely that they'll then temporarily lock your account and ask you to confirm your login.

In order to use the Facebook APIs to their max potential, we recommend [using a proxy](https://phantombuster.com/proxies) close to you. 

Also Facebook tends to notice when too many profiles viewings are done in a short period of time. We recommend spreading your scraping (like 5 profiles every 30min rather than 100 profiles in one go). Also if you're scraping more pages for additionnal data (like the Work and Education or Places tabs), you should reduce that amount even further. 
If too many viewing actions are done, Facebook will warn you and temporarily block profile viewing on your account for about one hour. If that happens, you should be careful and reduce your scraping frequency the next time.

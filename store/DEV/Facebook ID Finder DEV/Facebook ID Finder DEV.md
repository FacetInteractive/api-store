# The Facebook ID is more reliable than Facebook The profile URL
Facebook profile URLs, as they're personalizable, can be changed over time. 
A Facebook ID though is defined when the account is created and will stay permanently.

# Our Solution
From a Google spreadsheet filled with Facebook profile URLs, find **automatically** all associated Facebook IDs compiled in a CSV file.

# What will you need?
- **"spreadsheetUrl"**: Link of your Google spreadsheet (share options enabled)
- **"csvName"**: The name of your upcoming CSV

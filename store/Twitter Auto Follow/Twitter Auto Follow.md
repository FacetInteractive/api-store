## 6. Configure repetitive launches

Twitter will not let anyone follow many people over a short period of time (if you force this, you can be banned from Twitter).

That is why this API will only send up to **50 follow requests per launch**. To add many people, simply configure repetitive launches. All your follow requests will be spread out over days or weeks if necessary.

To do so, simply hit the “Settings” button to define when your API is launched.

## 7. Choose what the API should do 
The API can perform 3 specifics actions:
- Follow
- Unfollow
- Unfollow back (Unfollow only if the profile hasn't followed back)

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/settings-button.png)</center>

Then, select a frequency:

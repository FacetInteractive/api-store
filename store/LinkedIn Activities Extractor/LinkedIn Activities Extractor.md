## 4. Linkedin authentication 🔑 { argument }
Because the script will manipulate LinkedIn for you, it needs to be logged on your LinkedIn account. For that you just need to copy paste your session cookie in the script argument:
* Using Chrome, go to your LinkedIn homepage and open the inspector
→ Right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect” ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)

or

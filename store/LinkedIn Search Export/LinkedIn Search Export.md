LinkedIn Automation and Search Extraction are _the_ best way to very quickly create a lead file for your commercial team, recruitment purposes and much more.

## Extract all your connections in a single file

To scrape your first connections, use `http://linkedin.com/mynetwork/invite-connect/connections` as an input. 

You can do the same with all your Network Suggestions by using `https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/` as an input.

## Combine API and set your Prospection process on automatic. 

Combine it with our other LinkedIn APIs, <a href="/api-store/2818/linkedin-network-booster", target="_blank">LinkedIn Network Booster</a> for example, and you'll be able to connect at scale with the people you extracted.

## 4. Linkedin authentication üîë { argument }
Since Phantombuster will access LinkedIn for you, it needs to be logged on your LinkedIn account. For that you simply need to copy/paste your session cookie in the **session cookie** field:
* Using Chrome, go to your LinkedIn homepage and open the inspector  
‚Üí Right click anywhere on the page and select ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)  
‚Üí <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on macOS  
or  
‚Üí <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>MAJ</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows

* Locate the ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù tab

## 5. Decide which search you want to launch

In the _search_ text field, simply enter the terms you want to search on the LinkedIn search engine. For example _SpaceX engineer_ or _iOS developer_ or even _CEO_!

You can also input an URL to a Google Spreadsheet (or an URL to a CSV file) containing a list of searches to run. It's that easy! (make sure your file is publicly accessible)

**More advanced search queries are also possible** using keywords allowed by LinkedIn: `OR` & `AND` (see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75814", target="_blank">Using Boolean Search</a>) and even `school:`, `company:`... (see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/76015", target="_blank">Using Search Operators</a>).

**Even more advanced:** You can also paste into the _search_ field or your spreadsheet a LinkedIn search page URL. That is, make an advanced search yourself on LinkedIn and copy-paste the URL you're sent to into the field. If you're using a spreadsheet, you can chain search URLs from different categories (people, companies, etc.).
You can also append in the search page URL `&page=x` _(x represents a page number)_ to let know the API where it should start to scrape data in the LinkedIn result.

## 6. Which circles üí´?

If you're scraping a list of people, the three checkboxes allow you to target specific degrees of connections. If you want to scrape your connections, only enable the _1st_ checkbox. If you want to only find people that are close to you but not yet connected, enable the _2nd_ checkbox. And for the _3rd+_ checkbox, well... You get the picture.

## 7. Which category?

If you enter specific search terms (not search URLs), you can specify which category to search in. LinkedIn Search Export now handles searches for People, Jobs, Companies, Groups, and Schools.

## 8. How many pages of results?

Define here the number of pages you want the bot to scrape.
_Remember_  that the bot connects to your account in order to execute those scraping operations. In order to not exceed LinkedIn daily user's requests, Phantombuster advises you to use this API wisely.

**See <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950", target="_blank">LinkedIn Commercial Use Limit</a>.**

Note: We noticed that LinkedIn will not return more than 100 result pages.


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

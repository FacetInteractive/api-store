# Find email addresses in seconds

Your prospects' emails are everywhere the problem is: how to find and collect them?

The powerful Email Extractor API helps you to discover and extract emails automatically from a list of web pages and export all of them to a CSV file.

As always, on Phantombuster, **no need to keep your computer on**, everything happens in the cloud :D

# The process is simple

For each website you'll provide, the API will automatically:

- Extract all available emails
- Save all addresses in a CSV file in the cloud
- Filters for duplicate email

# What you'll need to set to make it work? ‚öôÔ∏è { argument }

- **CSV/ Spreadsheet URLs or URLs to scrape** { tutu }: The link of a Google Spreadsheet (or CSV) with websites URLs or a list of URL set manually.
- **Time to wait until the page is fully loaded**: The API needs to load the entire webpage and it takes time. More the website is complex more time the API needs to wait. Let the default value, it will work like a charm :)
- **Number of URLs to scrape per launch**: The API can be stopped at any time and relaunched later. This option defines the number of websites visited per launch.

# Convert your Sales Navigator URLs to default LinkedIn profile URLs

Got a list of Sales Navigator profile URLs and want to their regular profile URLs? 
Well that's all that API does :) And you don't even need a Sales Navigator account for it to work!
Note that for converting the Sales Navigator URL, the API needs to visit the profile for that URL.

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 

- **Session cookie**: Your session Cookie from LinkedIn
- **Spreadsheet URL**: Your spreadsheet URL as input
- **Number of lines to process per launch**: How many URLs to convert from your spreadsheet (all of them if empty)

## 4. Linkedin authentication üîë { argument }
Because the script will manipulate LinkedIn for you, it needs to be logged on your LinkedIn account. For that you just need to copy paste your session cookie in the script argument:
* Using Chrome, go to your LinkedIn homepage and open the inspector  
‚Üí Right click anywhere on the page and select ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)  
‚Üí <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on macOS  
or  
‚Üí <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>MAJ</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows

* Locate the ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù tab

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below your session cookies you‚Äôll find Spreadsheet URL.

Add in the Spreadsheet URL textbox the link of a Google spreadsheet with this same format **(Share option must be OPEN)**.

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of LinkedIn Sales Navigator Profile URLs (**one link per row**).

You can specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.
You can also enter a single SN Profile URL directly in the field.


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" and watch your API do the work for you!

# Limits

Please be aware that this API, like most of our LinkedIn APIs, will manipulate your own account on your behalf.

The API needs to visit the profile to convert the URL and we've noticed that visiting more than 80 profiles per day will almost always result in LinkedIn **invalidating your session cookie** (that is, logging you out). In that regard we recommend spacing your launches.

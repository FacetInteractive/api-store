# Extract every Post, People, Publications and Tags out of a Medium Search.

Medium is an underestimated source of traffic. Readers are avid of new quality content and writers are experts at very niche topics. It's often a place where ideas get tested before being formalized in a book.

The point of this API is for you to never miss an article about a topic you're fond of. Once you have that content you'll be able to take action with our other APIs: [Clap it](https://phantombuster.com/api-store/10910/medium-auto-clapper), comment it or directly reach its author.

# How to extract the results of a Medium search in seconds:

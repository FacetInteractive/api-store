# It's time to engage with developers where they hang out.

Recruiters, if you're specific about the skills you're looking for, stop LinkedIn, start reaching out for to the right persons in the right place. 

Github is not only a code repository, it's also a social network where developers hang out. If you're specific about the technology you're looking for, go the its Github repository and extract everyone who ever starred that project. 

You'll get super targeted leads interesting in that techno and if you're lucky some valuable email addresses.

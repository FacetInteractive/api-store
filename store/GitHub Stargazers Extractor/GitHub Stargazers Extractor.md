# It's time to engage with developers where they hang out.

Recruiters, if you're specific about the skills you're looking for, stop LinkedIn, start reaching out to the right persons in the right place. 

GitHub is not only a simple version control hosting service. It's also a social network where developers hang out. If you're specific about the technology you're looking for, visit its GitHub repository and extract the 1,000s latest people who starred that project. 

You'll get super targeted leads interested in that techno. Want to know those people better and even extract their emails? Use this API's result as an input to [GitHub Profile Scraper](https://phantombuster.com/api-store/11694/github-profile-scraper).

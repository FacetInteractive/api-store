## 4. Add a Google Spreadsheet 📑

Add in the Spreadsheet URL textbox the link of a Google spreadsheet with this same format **(Share option must be OPEN)**.

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Youtube Channel URLs (**one link per row**).

You can specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.
You can also enter a single Youtube Channel URL directly in the field.

# ⚙️️Repetition setup ⚙️

Now that your API is ready, you can customize it to make it work repetitively.

Use to 'Number of profiles to process per launch' field to configure how many profiles you want to scrape per launch (5 for instance will make it 5 profiles each launch then stop). Then set a repetition setup:

To do so, simply hit the “Settings” button to define when your API is launched.

Then, select a frequency:

There you go, the scraping will be made for you without you doing anything!


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!

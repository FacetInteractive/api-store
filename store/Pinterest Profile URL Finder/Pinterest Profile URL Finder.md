# Use names and or company names to find Pinterest profiles üîç

How are your competitors doing on social media platforms? Looking for Pinterest pages of a list of contacts? 

Starting from a spreadsheet filled with a list of names (and/or company names), Phantombuster will use search engines to automatically match names with their Pinterest profile URLs.

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 
- **"spreadsheetUrl"**: link of your spreadsheet

- **"columnName"**: title of the storing names column  in your document

## 4. Setting the Spreadsheet
Prepare a spreadsheet with **first name**/**last name** in a single cell

In order to match your search query with an Pinterest profile our API will use different search engines such as Google, Duckduckgo, Bing, Ecosia...

If the name you are searching for is pretty common we highly recommend you to add a **company name** in your search query for higher chances of positive results. 

You can also only search **company names**


## 5. Column Name

With one query per cell, make sure that first name/last name & company are in the same cell.
Use `columnName` to show our API what name you wrote on top of that column.
In the example above our `columnName` is: `Name_of_your_column`

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏è Repetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

If your input spreadsheet has a lot of rows, your Phantombuster account might not have enough execution time to find all the profile URLs in a single day. No worries though! You can set up **an automatic launch per day** to continue finding profile URLs over weeks or months if necessary.

To do so, first go to your API's settings:

Then, select `Once per day` (or another frequency if you prefer):

Now that this is set, click üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page. That's it! Your API will now add more and more rows to your result CSV file every day, automatically.

Note: You can also [buy more hours per day](https://phantombuster.com/upgrade) to speed up the process!
